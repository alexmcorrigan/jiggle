Jiggle
======
Jiggle is an app that sits in the background and after pre-defined periods of time will 'jiggle' the mouse.
The intended result being that it will stop windows thinking the current session is idle and prevent the screen / computer
going to sleep or remote sessions being logged out :wink:
